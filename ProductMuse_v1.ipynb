       "      <td>This community feedback channel is dedicated to the new Davis Anomaly Detection Analyzer in Notebooks/Dashboard/Workflows and will be available in version 289. With the introduction of the new Anomaly Detection Analyzer, we aim to make Davis Anomaly Detection more accessible and understandable than ever before. Allowing you to experiment with our Davis AI analyzers enables you to gather your own experiences on the different advantages each analyzer offers. With this experience and knowledge, you will be able to create the perfect anomaly detector for their domain-specific use case.\\n\\nwill we have access to more logical operators for metric events so that we can do something like 'Alert if the value is equal to' instead of just above or below?\\n\\nAs the new Anomaly Detectors are based on DQL and Grail you can always use the full spectrum of DQL logic operators to convert the timeseries into a 0 / 1 boolean and then use anomaly detection to alert by using the sliding window. You now can also combine multiple metric conditions by using DQL and much much more.\\n\\nImportant note: For seasonal models to work correctly, you need to append, interval:1min to your DQL query. Otherwise the training step will fail. In an upcoming version we already set that automatically, but in the preview version you need to set that manually.\\n\\nThis community feedback channel is dedicated to the new Davis Anomaly Detector will be available in version 291. Dynatrace Davis® AI covers many observabilities use cases out-of-the-box but needs the flexibility to adapt to domain-specific requirements. To address this, we offer Metric Events configurations that effectively fulfill many use cases. Now, with the introduction of the new Davis Anomaly Detector and the power of DQL, we can extend our reach to even more use cases.\\n\\nExactly, this upcoming Anomaly Detection method is built on top of the Grail DQL query language, which means that it is not available for Dynatrace Managed users. As it depends on the DQL query execution it can only run on environments that are Grail enabled.\\n\\nOn Grail there will be only DQL-based anomaly detectors along with edge-based ones (execuated on the ActiveGate or on the OneAgent). But all the cloud-side anomaly detectors will show up in that single page. 👍\\n\\njust a bit of feedback around the \"Show advanced properties\" toggle . The toggle here is misleading some users to think that the additional options would be enabled and used only if the toggle is turned on similar to the \"Alert on missing data\" toggle below . When a user tries to edit a already configured detector the \"Show advanced properties\" toggle would be turned off as expected but this is causing a bit of confusion for users thinking that this is not enabled .  I understand there is already a note next to toggle which explains what this toggle does, but having this represented in UI in a different way like a dropdown or a sub dropdown under Customize parameters might be a better option 🙂\\n\\nI've briefly played around some with this to test out alerting using an OR condition on multiple metrics and/or log content. So far I'm liking things here but a few comments / possible enhancement changes / questions 1. I added the Created column but there is no tooltip or other way to see the full value here. Same goes for other columns such as the query column. It is nice that we have extra columns we can add but it still doesn't do much good if we can't see the entire values\\n\\n# Is there any plan to allow for the ability to run the DQL to get a preview of the results? Or at least maybe have an option to maybe navigate to a notebook to run the query. The option is there to be able to open the davis anomaly detector app from within a notebook but not the other way around. I liked the option within the old UI of clicking 'Show in explorer' to validate your results before saving the metric event. As users get more proficient with things they may start with the davis detector app to create the detector rather than starting from a notebook 3. We utilize management zones heavily today. When creating a metric event the app team ties in their metric event to the mgmt zone in which the entity they are alerting on, is apart of. This works pretty well for us as it allows teams (AD groups) to have access to their metric events. How is access controlled in this new app? I believe there is an IAM policy statement to give access to use the app but is there any similar feature with this app so that teams can create, manage and see only their anomaly detectors much like they do today with their metric events?\\n\\nThank you very much for your feedback 🙂  1. Thank you. That is correct, and we're working on improving it.  2. Yes, there is already a possibility. In \"Action\" you'll see an option \"open with\" and there you can choose to open it in Notebooks/Dashboard or without leaving the app open in Notebooks/Preview.\\n\\n# Yes, it is planned, and we will introduce the \"service user\" in the near future first.\\n\\nWe are starting to make use of the new Davis Anomaly Detection app. Its great to see a step forward to having a more consistent approach to managing alerts. We are using a naming convention to align the detector \"Title\" with the \"Event Name\" to help track an alert back to what generate it. We are including support in our queries for a similarly named tag to allow specific entities to be included or excluded in the case of default alerts. We are using the Source field for a free text representation of which support team is accountable for the detector. It would great to find out more about the roadmap for improvements. Some considerations for the UI that would be nice to see – - Ability to export/import detectors so we can easily test/tune in non-prod then migrate to prod maybe similar to classic dashboards JSON ? - Persistent filters across sessions so we don’t have to add a filter every time we go into the app - Persistent columns across sessions - Adjust column widths, be able to see full modified/created timestamps. - See revision history eg. be able to easily see when updates were made to a detector over time - Ability to filter by detectors that have errors - Viewing errors needs to open without leaving the app (Update - Looks like this was fixed in v1.295) - Ability to set the Actor to a service account (I believe this is planned ?) - Option to set a schedule for when the detector is enabled - Bonus points for an option similar to maintenance windows where we can detect problems but not alert when its outside its normal schedule Eg. alert during business hours but only raise a problem and not alert after-hours - Add link to list problems that have been raised by that detector - Is there a way to set the timeframe when opening in a notebook without leaving the app ? Current bug - Entering a multi-line “Event description” seems to clear the event.description property? (Update - Looks like this was partially fixed in v1.295) Given the limits with metric events is anyone able to provide details around the scalability of the app eg. limits for the number of detector rules/dimensions. Looking forward to seeing the app improve over time.</td>\n",

       "      <td>h2. Extends the Dynatrace platform’s existing security capabilities to enable customers to drive Cloud-Native Application Protection at scale\\n\\nDynatrace (NYSE: DT), the leader in unified observability and security, today announced it is enhancing its platform with new Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) capabilities for observability-driven security, configuration, and compliance monitoring. This announcement follows the rapid integration of Runecast technology into the Dynatrace® platform following the company’s [+successful acquisition+|https://www.dynatrace.com/news/press-release/dynatrace-to-acquire-runecast/] earlier this year. The new KSPM offering builds on Dynatrace’s existing [+security protection capabilities+|https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/security-protection/], including Runtime Vulnerability Analytics (RVA) and Runtime Application Protection (RAP), strengthening cloud-native application protection in the Dynatrace platform. These combined capabilities provide DevSecOps, security, platform engineering, and SRE teams, who are all responsible for ensuring the security of Kubernetes environments, with an innovative solution for security posture and compliance.\\n\\n“As workloads become more dynamic, integrating KSPM into the deployment lifecycle is essential for the security of Kubernetes environments and adherence to best practices and standards,” says KellyAnn Fitzpatrick, Senior Analyst with RedMonk. “Through a combination of real-time vulnerability assessments and contextual security insights, Dynatrace’s new KSPM solution aims to empower teams to proactively address risks and achieve complete visibility into their security posture, compliance status, and attack vectors. Such solutions can enable teams to confidently accelerate their digital transformation, knowing that their cloud-native environment is protected.”\\n\\nDynatrace’s new KSPM solution, combined with the platform’s existing RVA and RAP capabilities, enables teams to instantly detect risks in their Kubernetes deployments and automatically prioritize remediation based on risk exposure. To achieve this at scale, Dynatrace uses [+Davis® hypermodal AI+|https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/artificial-intelligence/], which combines predictive and causal AI techniques for precise answers and automation and generative AI for increased productivity. As a result, teams can gain comprehensive insights into cloud-native applications across code, libraries, language runtime, and container infrastructure. This helps them strengthen the security posture of their Kubernetes deployments, while also complying with regulatory frameworks and industry best practices, including those defined by the Center for Internet Security ([+CIS+|https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks]).\\n\\n“While most teams rely on agentless workload scanning to enable KSPM, this snapshot approach is incapable of providing real-time insights and often causes a frequency of excessive alerts, without runtime context, that waste time and make remediation efforts more confusing,” said Bernd Greifeneder, CTO at Dynatrace. “As the attack surface of cloud applications continues to increase and attackers are targeting the misconfiguration of cloud infrastructure, APIs, and the software supply chain itself, organizations must evolve their solutions and processes to ensure their cloud technologies, including Kubernetes, are constantly protected against the latest risks and empower teams to operate with best practices. Building on the Dynatrace platform’s existing RVA and RAP capabilities, Dynatrace is delivering an innovative approach to KSPM that we believe sets us apart, providing teams with real-time insights, automated compliance, and actionable advice that free up resources and reduce exposure risk.”\\n\\nDynatrace Kubernetes Security Posture Management is expected to be generally available in the second half of 2024.\\n\\n*Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements*\\n\\nThis press release includes certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the capabilities of Dynatrace Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and the expected benefits to organizations from using Dynatrace Kubernetes Security Posture Management.

where we can see the history of change and the impacts of each change over-time. Two ideas that come to mind for me:\\n\\n  1 - what was the nature of change from one release to the next? lines of code? new processes/groups? new hosts? new queries?\\n\\n  2 - what is the qualification for the changes by risk? were there changes to critical components or traffic flows? were there any changes to components with a \"high instability\" historically? \\n\\n \\n\\nMaybe SRG (and/or Keptn) can have links/tags back to the code? or even connect to the new Live Debugging features coming later this year?   \n",
       "1   This community feedback channel is dedicated to the new Davis Anomaly Detection Analyzer in Notebooks/Dashboard/Workflows and will be available in version 289. With the introduction of the new Anomaly Detection Analyzer, we aim to make Davis Anomaly Detection more accessible and understandable than ever before. Allowing you to experiment with our Davis AI analyzers enables you to gather your own experiences on the different advantages each analyzer offers. With this experience and knowledge, you will be able to create the perfect anomaly detector for their domain-specific use case.\\n\\nwill we have access to more logical operators for metric events so that we can do something like 'Alert if the value is equal to' instead of just above or below?\\n\\nAs the new Anomaly Detectors are based on DQL and Grail you can always use the full spectrum of DQL logic operators to convert the timeseries into a 0 / 1 boolean and then use anomaly detection to alert by using the sliding window. You now can also combine multiple metric conditions by using DQL and much much more.\\n\\nImportant note: For seasonal models to work correctly, you need to append, interval:1min to your DQL query. Otherwise the training step will fail. In an upcoming version we already set that automatically, but in the preview version you need to set that manually.\\n\\nThis community feedback channel is dedicated to the new Davis Anomaly Detector will be available in version 291. Dynatrace Davis® AI covers many observabilities use cases out-of-the-box but needs the flexibility to adapt to domain-specific requirements. To address this, we offer Metric Events configurations that effectively fulfill many use cases. Now, with the introduction of the new Davis Anomaly Detector and the power of DQL, we can extend our reach to even more use cases.\\n\\nExactly, this upcoming Anomaly Detection method is built on top of the Grail DQL query language, which means that it is not available for Dynatrace Managed users. As it depends on the DQL query execution it can only run on environments that are Grail enabled.\\n\\nOn Grail there will be only DQL-based anomaly detectors along with edge-based ones (execuated on the ActiveGate or on the OneAgent). But all the cloud-side anomaly detectors will show up in that single page. 👍\\n\\njust a bit of feedback around the \"Show advanced properties\" toggle . The toggle here is misleading some users to think that the additional options would be enabled and used only if the toggle is turned on similar to the \"Alert on missing data\" toggle below . When a user tries to edit a already configured detector the \"Show advanced properties\" toggle would be turned off as expected but this is causing a bit of confusion for users thinking that this is not enabled .  I understand there is already a note next to toggle which explains what this toggle does, but having this represented in UI in a different way like a dropdown or a sub dropdown under Customize parameters might be a better option 🙂\\n\\nI've briefly played around some with this to test out alerting using an OR condition on multiple metrics and/or log content. So far I'm liking things here but a few comments / possible enhancement changes / questions 1. I added the Created column but there is no tooltip or other way to see the full value here. Same goes for other columns such as the query column. It is nice that we have extra columns we can add but it still doesn't do much good if we can't see the entire values\\n\\n# Is there any plan to allow for the ability to run the DQL to get a preview of the results? Or at least maybe have an option to maybe navigate to a notebook to run the query. The option is there to be able to open the davis anomaly detector app from within a notebook but not the other way around. I liked the option within the old UI of clicking 'Show in explorer' to validate your results before saving the metric event. As users get more proficient with things they may start with the davis detector app to create the detector rather than starting from a notebook 3. We utilize management zones heavily today. When creating a metric event the app team ties in their metric event to the mgmt zone in which the entity they are alerting on, is apart of. This works pretty well for us as it allows teams (AD groups) to have access to their metric events. How is access controlled in this new app? I believe there is an IAM policy statement to give access to use the app but is there any similar feature with this app so that teams can create, manage and see only their anomaly detectors much like they do today with their metric events?\\n\\nThank you very much for your feedback 🙂  1. Thank you. That is correct, and we're working on improving it.  2. Yes, there is already a possibility. In \"Action\" you'll see an option \"open with\" and there you can choose to open it in Notebooks/Dashboard or without leaving the app open in Notebooks/Preview.\\n\\n# Yes, it is planned, and we will introduce the \"service user\" in the near future first.\\n\\nWe are starting to make use of the new Davis Anomaly Detection app. Its great to see a step forward to having a more consistent approach to managing alerts. We are using a naming convention to align the detector \"Title\" with the \"Event Name\" to help track an alert back to what generate it. We are including support in our queries for a similarly named tag to allow specific entities to be included or excluded in the case of default alerts. We are using the Source field for a free text representation of which support team is accountable for the detector. It would great to find out more about the roadmap for improvements. Some considerations for the UI that would be nice to see – - Ability to export/import detectors so we can easily test/tune in non-prod then migrate to prod maybe similar to classic dashboards JSON ? - Persistent filters across sessions so we don’t have to add a filter every time we go into the app - Persistent columns across sessions - Adjust column widths, be able to see full modified/created timestamps. - See revision history eg. be able to easily see when updates were made to a detector over time - Ability to filter by detectors that have errors - Viewing errors needs to open without leaving the app (Update - Looks like this was fixed in v1.295) - Ability to set the Actor to a service account (I believe this is planned ?) - Option to set a schedule for when the detector is enabled - Bonus points for an option similar to maintenance windows where we can detect problems but not alert when its outside its normal schedule Eg. alert during business hours but only raise a problem and not alert after-hours - Add link to list problems that have been raised by that detector - Is there a way to set the timeframe when opening in a notebook without leaving the app ? Current bug - Entering a multi-line “Event description” seems to clear the event.description property? (Update - Looks like this was partially fixed in v1.295) Given the limits with metric events is anyone able to provide details around the scalability of the app eg. limits for the number of detector rules/dimensions.

Extends the Dynatrace platform’s existing security capabilities to enable customers to drive Cloud-Native Application Protection at scale\\n\\nDynatrace (NYSE: DT), the leader in unified observability and security, today announced it is enhancing its platform with new Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) capabilities for observability-driven security, configuration, and compliance monitoring. This announcement follows the rapid integration of Runecast technology into the Dynatrace® platform following the company’s [+successful acquisition+|https://www.dynatrace.com/news/press-release/dynatrace-to-acquire-runecast/] earlier this year. The new KSPM offering builds on Dynatrace’s existing [+security protection capabilities+|https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/security-protection/], including Runtime Vulnerability Analytics (RVA) and Runtime Application Protection (RAP), strengthening cloud-native application protection in the Dynatrace platform. These combined capabilities provide DevSecOps, security, platform engineering, and SRE teams, who are all responsible for ensuring the security of Kubernetes environments, with an innovative solution for security posture and compliance.\\n\\n“As workloads become more dynamic, integrating KSPM into the deployment lifecycle is essential for the security of Kubernetes environments and adherence to best practices and standards,” says KellyAnn Fitzpatrick, Senior Analyst with RedMonk. “Through a combination of real-time vulnerability assessments and contextual security insights, Dynatrace’s new KSPM solution aims to empower teams to proactively address risks and achieve complete visibility into their security posture, compliance status, and attack vectors. Such solutions can enable teams to confidently accelerate their digital transformation, knowing that their cloud-native environment is protected.”\\n\\nDynatrace’s new KSPM solution, combined with the platform’s existing RVA and RAP capabilities, enables teams to instantly detect risks in their Kubernetes deployments and automatically prioritize remediation based on risk exposure. To achieve this at scale, Dynatrace uses [+Davis® hypermodal AI+|https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/artificial-intelligence/], which combines predictive and causal AI techniques for precise answers and automation and generative AI for increased productivity. As a result, teams can gain comprehensive insights into cloud-native applications across code, libraries, language runtime, and container infrastructure. This helps them strengthen the security posture of their Kubernetes deployments, while also complying with regulatory frameworks and industry best practices, including those defined by the Center for Internet Security ([+CIS+|https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks]).\\n\\n“While most teams rely on agentless workload scanning to enable KSPM, this snapshot approach is incapable of providing real-time insights and often causes a frequency of excessive alerts, without runtime context, that waste time and make remediation efforts more confusing,” said Bernd Greifeneder, CTO at Dynatrace. “As the attack surface of cloud applications continues to increase and attackers are targeting the misconfiguration of cloud infrastructure, APIs, and the software supply chain itself, organizations must evolve their solutions and processes to ensure their cloud technologies, including Kubernetes, are constantly protected against the latest risks and empower teams to operate with best practices. Building on the Dynatrace platform’s existing RVA and RAP capabilities, Dynatrace is delivering an innovative approach to KSPM that we believe sets us apart, providing teams with real-time insights, automated compliance, and actionable advice that free up resources and reduce exposure risk.”\\n\\nDynatrace Kubernetes Security Posture Management is expected to be generally available in the second half of 2024.\\n\\n*Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements*\\n\\nThis press release includes certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the capabilities of Dynatrace Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and the expected benefits to organizations from using Dynatrace Kubernetes Security Posture Management.

Productboard and the only real issue I have is that I cannot capture insights without them linking to an idea. This means that either I have all ideas logged and expect the insights raiser to scroll through that long list to find the correct one (unlikely) OR every insight raised will be raised as a new idea (this is the more likely scenario).   This then means that I will have to manage and merge all of these to keep the parking lot ideas in some kind of order. Does anyone have any advice on alternative ways of doing this or ways they have structured the project to make it manageable?   \n",

If so, how? When I search ideas/issues, does that include text within insights? I can't even seem to get the insights field to display when I get idea/issue search results. Where is it hiding?   \n",

                       Hi I normally use and like these levels: - Insight - Problem/opportunity (normally a pain, job or gain) - Solution   Insights come from customer interviews, market research or competitors analysis and feed opportunities. (productboard does also differentiate like this)   I know you are working on a way to better distinguish problems from solutions inputs so that they can be visualised more easily from a tree. However, my questions are: 1. Are there ways to register new insights from outside the main idea object so that you don't necessarily link an insight to a particular opportunity from the beginning but maybe later? 2. Thus, is there a way to visualise insights in a list?\\n\\nHi I normally use and like these levels: - Insight - Problem/opportunity (normally a pain, job or gain) - Solution   Insights come from customer interviews, market research or competitors analysis and feed opportunities.

asks we get on the CX side of our business prior to having prioritization planning with our R&D teams. Because the insights come from so many channels (ex. Gainsight managed customers, Community posts, Zendesk managed customers, NPS campaigns, etc.) we have been looking to quantify the number of asks from each channel. As we have a growing list of insights from various channels attached to each request, I am looking to add custom fields on each request for specific channels. I was trying to explore if there was a way in the automation to extract information from Insights to update custom fields and was wondering if there was any guidance here. For example: If someone adds an Insight from our Community (which would always come from our Community URL) is there a way for automation to update a custom field named \"Count of community requests\" on the ticket? The idea here would be able to build reports/lists based on the top requested Ideas, per feedback channel.\\n\\nWe have been using JPD to gather and quantify the asks we get on the CX side of our business prior to having prioritization planning with our R&D teams.

figure out how to do it. The API doesn't list the insights when quering a ticket, the field stays \"null\". Is there any other way of extracting insights (and comments by extension) from JIRA?   \n",

feedback\\n\\nHi JPD team, We have collected a lot of customer feedback as ideas, and it would be awesome if JPD could help use summarize all that feedback. So, I am dreaming about a feature where I could feed all these ideas to an AI and get a nice summary back. Something like: Select 1000 ideas and ask AI to have a look at them. When the AI is done doing its magic, The AI writes to me. AI: I have read through all of the feedback you have captured, and I am now ready to help you understand what matters most to your customers. Let me start with the top topics that your customers give feedback about [topic will show here. it could include user management]. me:  Thanks. I can see that a user management is in the top. What are the most requested features for user management. AI: Sure, 13% of the feedback is about Google Workspace SSO. It seems that your customers need support for Google Workspace SSO in addition to Azure AD SSO. Would you like me the list the customers? me: Sure...   \n",

How might I do that?\\n\\nI have a field for relationship for ideas from insights. How might I link the insight from one idea to another? I would love to get the url of each so I can populate that field unless there is a better way to do this. And by that I don't mean a URL insight source I pasted in but the actual \"Insight\" itself.   And is there a way to enable that as functionality fairly easily and quickly ? As a quick win?   \n",
